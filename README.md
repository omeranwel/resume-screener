# Resume Screener

## Project Overview:
The Resume Screener is a tool designed to screen resumes against a given job description, calculating the similarity between the two. It uses machine learning techniques to compare the contents of a resume with the requirements of the job, helping recruiters to easily shortlist candidates based on relevance.

## Features:
- Resume screening based on job description
- Text pre-processing with scikit-learn
- Cosine similarity to calculate match between resume and job description
- FastAPI-based API for integration

## Getting Started:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/omeranwel/resume-screener.git
